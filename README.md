# Hi, I'm Katie! üåü

I'm a junior at UNC Chapel Hill studying Computer Science and Information Science. I'm pursuing a career in software engineering, and I am interested in full-stack development and promoting usability. I am always trying to learn more and I love collaborating with those around me.

On campus, I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for COMP110 where I work with our instructor and 60+ teaching assistants to aid 800+ students across technical and nontechnical majors. I am able to provide individualized support in office hours, quickly diagnose student code issues in real time, and clearly communicate effective solutions and underlying concepts.

I also contribute to the News Engineering Team at The Daily Tar Heel, serve as Co-Director of Recruitment for Kappa Theta Pi, a professional technology organization, and I am an active member of my sorority, Pi Beta Phi.  

‚û°Ô∏è Currently: I'm catching up on my reading list, studying for my AWS certification, and planning KTP recruitment!!

‚ö° Outside of school: I like hiking, painting, live music, and interior design
